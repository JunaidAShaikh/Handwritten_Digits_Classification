# Handwritten_Digits_Classification
1. Implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and its performance evaluation in classifying handwritten digits
2. Use the same network to analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library
